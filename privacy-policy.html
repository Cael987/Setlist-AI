    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April 28, 2025</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Setlist AI collects the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio recordings (temporary, for song identification only)</li>
            <li>Video data (when using the video analysis feature)</li>
            <li>Playlist information and liked songs</li>
            <li>Music service authentication tokens</li>
            <li><strong>Spotify account information</strong>(user ID for playlist creation) and OAuth access tokens</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify songs using Shazam’s technology</li>
            <li>Create and manage your playlists</li>
            <li>Connect with Apple Music and Spotify services</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We integrate with the following services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shazam for song recognition</li>
            <li>Apple Music for playlist export and playback</li>
            <li>Spotify for playlist export and playback (see section 4)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Spotify Integration</h2>
        <p>When you choose to export playlists to Spotify, Setlist AI uses the Spotify Web API via OAuth 2.0. You will be prompted to authorize the following scopes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>playlist-modify-public</code>: Create and manage public playlists</li>
            <li><code>playlist-modify-private</code>: Create and manage private playlists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These permissions are requested only when you initiate a Spotify export. Your short-lived Spotify access token is handled securely while needed for the export operation and is not persistently stored by the app. You can revoke Setlist AI’s access at any time by visiting your Spotify account’s Apps settings: <a href="https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/" target="_blank">https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device. Audio recordings are processed in real-time and are not stored. Authentication tokens (Apple Music & Spotify) are kept in secure storage. We do not transmit audio recordings to our servers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>Setlist AI does not use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect personal data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your Spotify OAuth tokens only for as long as necessary to provide the export functionality. Audio recordings and video data are temporary and discarded immediately after processing. You can delete your playlists and liked songs data from within the app at any time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access and review your stored playlists and liked songs</li>
            <li>Delete your data from the app at any time</li>
            <li>Opt out of specific features (e.g., disconnect your Spotify account via <a href="https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/" target="_blank">Spotify Applications</a>)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of Setlist AI after changes have been made constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
